Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git

	in the repository when both sets of changes are finished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used when you wish to use someone elses github repostitory as a basis for your work and publicly acknowledge the fact.
	Clones are used to copy other peoples public work that is published on github, 
	or to create a new repository the same as an existing branch on a local machine.
	Branches are used to create a separate thread on a repository.
